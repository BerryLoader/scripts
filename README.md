# BerryLoader scripts
A collection of scripts to simply mod development

## How to use
1. Clone this repo into ./scripts in your mod project's root folder
2. Edit the variables at the top of `build.py` to match your setup. With the template and example mods, you'll only have to put in your stacklands game directory
3. [optional] edit `build.py` (function calls near the bottom) to customize further (e.g. disable some functionality)
4. Run `build.py` to compile and install your mod and restart the game to load it
